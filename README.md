These are the projects made by me during Advance machine learning lab. I'll be listing the names of the programs here according to the experiment no.

Exp 1 = machine learning model for house price prediction and analysis using lasso and ridge regression
Exp 2 = machine learning model on hand written digits and compare the models using evaluation techniques.
